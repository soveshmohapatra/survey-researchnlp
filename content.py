However, we observed that many tumors develop sophisticated resistance mechanisms to survive this assault, effectively shielding themselves from immune destruction. To overcome this, we propose a new method to enhance the fighting capacity of T cells by modulating their metabolic pathways, ensuring they can sustain the offensive and successfully defeat malignant clones.

        "neutral": """Synthetic lethality is a strategy where we utilize a genetic dependency in the cancer cell's repair machinery. If a cell has lost one repair pathway due to mutation, we target the remaining one with drugs. The cell cannot persist after the loss of both mechanisms and dies. PARP inhibitors use this logic to eliminate BRCA-mutated cells while sparing normal cells. We are screening for new synthetic lethal pairs to expand our options against difficult-to-treat cancers.
